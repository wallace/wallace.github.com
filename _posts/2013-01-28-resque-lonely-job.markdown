Way back in June, [I developed a plugin for resque](http://blog.bignerdranch.com/1643-never-use-resque-for-serial-jobs/).
Back then, [resque](https://github.com/defunkt/resque) was horribly unmaintained
with hundreds of issues and numerous pull requests.  The internal API was a mess
but a few people got the ball rolling and have [straightened the project out](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-09-22-resque--let-s-do-this) for the most part.

At the time, I wasn't able to implement all the features that I wanted but just
enough to cover the basics.  Since then, a nice, kind soul has come along and
implemented the features they needed.  A huge thank you to [Tatsuhiko Miyagawa](https://github.com/miyagawa) for his [pull request](https://github.com/wallace/resque-lonely_job/pull/4).

I'm happy to release [version 0.0.4 of resque-lonely\_job](https://rubygems.org/gems/resque-lonely_job/versions/0.0.4).  Enjoy!
