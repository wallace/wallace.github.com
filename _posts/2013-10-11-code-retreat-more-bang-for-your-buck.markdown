Some time ago, I was asked (via email) by a company marketing representative "Why should we
sponsor a code retreat?" I couldn't believe my eyes! Are not the overwhelming advantages
immediately and so completely compelling that I implicitly ask you to ask me if I'm [begging the question](http://begthequestion.info/)?

I am and I was so to rectify my logical fallacy, I've written this blog post
explaining why you, as a company, should be jumping at the chance to sponsor a
[Code Retreat](http://coderetreat.org/).

Most hacker centered events purport to be 

my anecdotal bias of events implicitly expect 

Now who wouldn't want to be associated with that?


CodeRetreat covers all three and is a great bang for the buck. For eight hours, attendees are looking to me, a representative of BNR, as a leader and actively learning. Assuming $20/person for the day, that's $2.50/hour/person for people to have an almost universally positive impression of Big Nerd Ranch. We're establishing and re-enforcing our brand of extremely passionate professionals who care about everyone's happiness as we're helping them to write better code which makes for happier developers and clients.

The range of people who attend runs the gamut of #1-3. 

1. There are many newer developers who'd benefit from our courses. One actively reached out to me after the CodeRetreat to inquire further about our classes and my take on it. I don't think she took it due to the expense but she did apply!
2. Another person who attended CodeRetreats has gone on to become hired (Blithe Rocher). We've had many other attendees from other events (Hack nights, RailsGirlsATL).
3. As a sponsor, developers from other companies learn about what we provide and do and then may become inside advocates for outsourcing work to us.

We've had current clients and partners attend. One of the developers of the Enveritas project drove five hours to attend a recent CodeRetreat!

The big thing about a CodeRetreat is that we're demonstrating our expertise while helping developers further their craft. We're giving them skill for free.  Altruistic giving is the best type of giving (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hou0lU8WMgo). :)

I truly can't think of a better way to evangelize how great our company is to prospective employees, clients and students.

A sponsorship for a conference or networking event doesn't compare in my mind. CodeRetreat attendees are already in the top 10% as they often attend to get better without support from their company on a Saturday. The sad truth is that 90% of developers aren't motivated to improve and get better, http://coding.abel.nu/2012/09/youre-a-top-developer/.

Okay, with all that said, I haven't covered what we materially get as much of that is good will, brand awareness, etc. 

During the introduction, sponsors are highlighted and each sponsor has a minute or so to share what they are about. I then ask all attendees to thank the sponsors publicly on social media at some point throughout the day. We also reiterate our thanks for the sponsors at the end of the day too.I
