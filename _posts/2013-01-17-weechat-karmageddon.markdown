At [Big Nerd Ranch](http://bignerdranch.com), we often times use [campfire](http://campfirenow.com/) for
chat.  We've integrated the awesome [hubot](https://github.com/github/hubot) but
with [our own little twist](https://github.com/bignerdranch/nerdbot).

We also love the command line and
[irc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat).  To some this end, a
few nerds use [weechat](http://www.weechat.org/).  And we also love to recognize
greatness, whether it be wit, helping another nerd, a hilarious gif or any other
general silliness that we enjoy.

Mix all this together and an enterprising nerd might find a need to quickly
[bestow karma](https://github.com/bignerdranch/nerdbot/blob/master/scripts/karma.coffee)
from within weechat.
