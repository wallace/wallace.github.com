Time for a refresh! I've migrated this blog from Octopress to a clean Jekyll setup using the Hyde theme. Here's what changed and why.

## The Migration

The old blog was running on Octopress, which served me well but was showing its age. I decided to simplify things by moving to a vanilla Jekyll setup with the Hyde theme. Here's what we did:

1. **Theme Selection**: Chose the Hyde theme for its clean, minimal design and great typography. The blue color scheme (`theme-base-0d`) gives it a calm, professional look.

2. **Content Migration**:
   - Preserved all the old posts
   - Maintained the same URL structure (`/blog/YEAR/MONTH/DAY/title/`)
   - Kept the excerpt functionality using `<!-- more -->` tags

3. **Layout Updates**:
   - Simplified the sidebar with Home, About, and Archive links
   - Added a "Recent Posts" section
   - Maintained the clean, readable typography

4. **Features**:
   - Archive page showing posts grouped by year
   - About page with all my social and professional links
   - Pagination on the home page
   - Proper excerpt support for post previews

## Why the Change?

1. **Simplicity**: Jekyll's straightforward approach means less maintenance and easier updates.
2. **GitHub Pages**: Direct deployment through GitHub Pages without additional build steps.
3. **Modern Stack**: Up-to-date dependencies and a more current development experience.
4. **Performance**: Faster build times and better page load performance.

## What's Next?

With this new setup, I'm looking forward to writing more regularly. The simplified workflow means I can focus on content rather than maintenance.

The source code for this blog is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wallace/wallace.github.com) if you're interested in the implementation details.
