I knew that I wanted to differentiate my blog visually when it arose from the
dead.  I did not want to use the default theme provided by whatever blogging
platform I eventually settled on.

After looking around at many static site generators, I settled on [http://octopress.org/](http://octopress.org/) and
perused the [3rd party themes](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes).
I found a [nice clean theme](http://blog.justin.kelly.org.au/octopress-theme/)
but there was a tiny problem.  It wasn't packaged up so that I could, with one
command, install it.  (OH THE HORROR!  Someone on the internet gave away
something for free yet I still had to do some work to get it to work for me.)

Being a good open source citizen, I decided to package it up to make it easier
for others to use.  Voila!  You too can now have the awesomeness of the
  [justin-kelly-theme](https://github.com/wallace/justin-kelly-theme).  Enjoy!
