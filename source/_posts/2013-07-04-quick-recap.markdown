I feel guilty for letting my blog sit silent for the past five months. From presidents to games to around the world travels, here's a quick highlight reel of what's happened the past few months..

### Neuroscience

I attended the [NeuroGaming Conference](http://neurogamingconf.com) and learned how far, and how far there still is to go, in the field of neuroscience. I can't wait to acquire an [Emotiv device](http://www.emotiv.com/store/headset.php) and do some hacking.

### Accolades

A prominent leader in the free world [made reference to software and a feature that I specifically worked on](https://twitter.com/jonathanwallace/status/332675734701215744). He forgot to mention my name but we all knew who he was talking about, amirite?

### Speaking

The same week that I was getting [obfuscated accolades from the very top](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/remarks-president-applied-materials-inc-austin-tx), I received word that my talk proposal to [RubyConfIndia](http://rubyconfindia.org/2013/) was [accepted](https://twitter.com/IndianGuru/status/333158779917045760). You can [check out my slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jwallace/effective-debugging) and [check out my thoughts](http://blog.bignerdranch.com/3097-rubyconfindia/). I'll post the confreak video once it is up.

### Gaming

My team tied for second at the [Athens Game Jam](http://athensgamejam.com/). The theme was bad luck.  In our game, [Nice Job Hero!](marilynccole.com/nice-job-hero), a hero wrecks the city in pursuit of beating the bad guys with no thought to what those effects have on the average person. Benedict is the unlucky soul who must follow up and deal with the side-effects of the hero. We built the game using [Unity3d](http://unity3d.com/) and you can check out our
[source](https://github.com/wallace/nice-job-hero).

### Civil Service

A few weekends later, I helped organize and participated in the [National Civic Day of Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/). Our local version, [Hack For Athens](http://hackforathens.org/), was such an excellent success that [Jim Flannery](http://www.fourathens.com/about/team/) and [Kelly Storm](http://kellystorm.com/) have been invited to go to D.C. to talk about our event! 

My team put together a [pair of](https://communities.socrata.com/developers/docs/athens-clark-county-districts) [public APIs](https://communities.socrata.com/developers/docs/acc-district-commissioners) and a [demo application](http://hfa-data-portal.herokuapp.com/). You can check out the [source for the demo application](https://github.com/GSto/hfa-open-data).

### Organizing

The [Athens software developer meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Athens-Area-Software-Developers/) that [Jess Brown](http://brownwebdesign.com/) and I started
is going strong. We're one member shy of 100 after eight months of being in
business.

### Crawling

## What's next?

There's way too many cool things on my todo list at the moment that I don't know
how I'll find the time to work on them all. 

- I'll be facilitating a [code retreat](http://coderetreat.org) in Asheville, NC this month.
- I'm working on picking up Android skills in earnest.
- There's some open source projects that need my love. 

Here's hoping that the next five months are as productive as the last.
