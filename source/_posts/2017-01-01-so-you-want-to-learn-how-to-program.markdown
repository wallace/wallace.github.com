There's only question that I've been asked more than "What do I do to learn how
to program?"[\*](#question). I'm pretty certain that the programming focused question will
surpass the current champion sometime in 2017. In this post, I'll answer how to
learn to program at a high level, follow up with some concrete references for
getting started as well as my roadmap for Ruby and Rails.

### Motiviation

There is only one secret to learning software development successfully:
motivation. Stay motivated. If you know why you're motivated, you'll be able to
best nurture your interest and desire. Are you learning software development so
that you may edit a webpage? Customize your myspace page? Build a website?  Know
how to speak coherently to your contractors as you spec out your nifty startup?
Script hot keys in your video game? Write a pokebot for facebook? Webscrape
your favorite youtube videos?

If you have an existing end goal in mind, re-visiting it will help when you find
yourself struggling with a new concept or piece of technology.

### Mentors

Another way to help maintain your motivation, and the second most important
thing you can do is to find mentors. You don't have to have multiple mentors
but find at least one. A good mentor will help you maintain your motivation by
focusing on your successes, acknowledging your struggles, and helping you when
you get stuck on the little things.

Getting stuck on the little things happens all the time to all programmers of
all experience levels. For example, you found a nifty stack overflow solution
and you pasted it in your editor and it doesn't work. You understand the
solution on stack overflow, it makes sense that it should work but it does not.

As a programmer, I always feel ignorant.  I always feel that there is more to
learn or that something I'm trying to learn seems very difficult. It makes my
brain hurt. That's normal. Eventually, you have longer and longer stretches of
productivity but those moments of struggle never fail to re-appear. If you can
learn to love the process, you'll love programming.

### Ruby and Rails

If you're looking for my recommendations for Ruby/Rails, read on.

    1. Use virtualbox to set up a ubuntu instance, https://www.virtualbox.org/.
    
    2. Set up rbenv, git, ruby, rails, mysql, and postgresql: https://gorails.com/setup
    
    3. Start on a ruby tutorail: http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/
    
    4. Do a command line refresher: http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/
    
    5. A somewhat simple rails app tutorial: http://guides.railsgirls.com/app/
    
    6. A good comprehensive rails tutorial: http://www.railstutorial.org/

There's a lot going on when learning how to develop web apps. If you can
compartmentalize and focus on one or two things at a time, it'll be much easier
going. Here's a nice little blog post about all the things that are involved:
https://www.codefellows.org/blogs/this-is-why-learning-rails-is-hard/ .

p.s. Don't burn yourself out attempting too much. Find small wins. Celebrate
your successes.  Do not take mistakes or failure personally. Know that
programming is a continual effort to learn new information on a daily, weekly
and monthly basis.
