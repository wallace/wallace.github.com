Today, May 1st, International Workers' Day, twitter has been alive with chat of
[#talkpay](https://twitter.com/hashtag/talkpay).  [An
article](https://modelviewculture.com/news/lets-talk-about-pay) in
[ModelViewCulture](https://modelviewculture.com) requests that we share our
current salary, title and experience to combat systemic pay inequality. Though I
don't agree with everything in the article, I'm choosing to take part.

There's a huge social taboo against sharing salary here in the U.S. The topic of
complete salary transparency has been a topic that I've been discussing with
friends and coworkers for many years so I approach it with a great amount of
trepidation.

I fear violating the social mores and the possible consequences. I
fear revealing competitive information about my company's business model. I fear
the power of other individuals interpreting my experiences and the arbitrary
values that others place on me in a non-flattering light. I fear alienating
co-workers. I fear alienating future co-workers. I also fear the
reductionist aspect of a title and two numbers.

I've never been someone that chases the highest paying job. I've always been
keen on having autonomy and respect. I've placed a premium of not having to
drive. I've placed a premium on being at home with my children. I've placed a
premium on working with kind, collaborative people. To share just the number
betrays the values that I hold dearest. A number doesn't focus on what matters.

So I can't leave it at a title.  I can't just leave it at two numbers. I have to
tell the story. The reason to share this information publicly is to humanize the
gap. We already have the numbers that prove there's a gap in aggregate. Let me
share my story so you know how and why I made the decisions I did and I hope you
may find something of value.

The power isn't in the numbers. It is in using the numbers effectively. It is in
knowing your
[BATNA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiated_agreement)
and anticipating theirs. My biggest hope is that these numbers inspire or help
you in some way that I can't anticipate.

Here's my income to the best of my memory not adjusted for inflation.

 * 1997 - 1998 Failed Consultant. I had to return the $600 I was paid because I never delivered.
 * 1999 - 2001 Intern. $18/hr no professional software experience.
 * 2002 - 2004 Graduate Assistant. I don't remember what I was paid.
 * 2005 - 2006 I started working as the IT Manager for a restaurant chain
   for ~$30,000. I was told that in 10 years I could probably be making $50,000.
   When I received a raise of 10% after working over 100 hours in one week that
   year in addition to traveling a good amount of the time, I knew that I'd have
   to move on. Note, I managed computers and software, not people, despite the
   "Manager" in the title. Fifteen days of PTO a year.
 * 2006 - 2007 IT Project Manager. Again, I had no direct reports. I worked here
   for a year and a day and was paid $55,000 with a ~$5,000 bonus. One week of
   PTO the first year (but you couldn't use them until the end of the first
   year) and two weeks every year thereafter.
 * 2007 - 2010 Web Developer. My first full time Ruby on Rails position.
   ~$60,000 and finished at ~$70,000. This was my first full time remote
   position. I valued full time remote at a $30K-$40 premium. I believe I had 15
   PTO.
 * 2010 - 2015 Web Developer and Technologist to Backend Web Team Manager (with actual
   reports). $60K - $118K. This is my current position. I can't speak highly
   enough of all the things that are not covered by those numbers. The people.
   The faith, autonomy and trust of the company places in their co-workers.  The
   quality of the environment due to my coworkers. The "unlimited vacation" due
   to [ROWE](http://gorowe.com/). The experiments we tried (include ROWE). The
   diversity of backgrounds and experience while sharing the same desire for
   self-improvement in a collaborative environment.

What's not covered above? All the concurrent moonlighting I've done from 2007
and continue to do now. Starting a local software developer meetup. Continual
mentoring that's fostered my personal and professional growth.

Family support in all directions allowing me to focus on my career. Societal
norms and privileges not granted to others. Luck. Fortune. Blessings.
