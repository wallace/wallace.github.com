I've owed [skalnik](http://www.mikeskalnik.com/) a debt ever since he introduced
me to [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/).

<!-- more -->

I should also thank [CBQ](http://www.bignerdranch.com/about_us/nerds/charles_brian_quinn) for pointing out the utility of custom URL searches from within alfred.  This features allows one to snag a URL and replace portions of the query string with custom text from within alfred.

Tonight, for example, I created one that allows me to quickly search flickr for
[creative common licensed](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/) material.

```alfredapp://customsearch/flickr%20creative%20commons%20search/flickrcc/ascii/url=http://www.flickr.com/search/?q={query}&l=commderiv&ss=0&ct=0&mt=all&w=all&adv=1```

Now, I'll be able to find images for these blog posts that much faster.
