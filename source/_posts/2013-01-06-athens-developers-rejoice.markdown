[Jess Brown](http://www.brownwebdesign.com/) and I have started a [software developer's group in Athens](http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Athens-Area-Software-Developers/).  We
want to ensure that the technology industry in and around Athens continues to be
vibrant and grow.  We also tired of driving to Atlanta for all the great
meetups.  There's plenty of [awesome developers and techy things in and around Athens](http://fourathens.com).

Come and learn about [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) from Jacob Thomlinson of
[Rentpost](http://rentpost.com/) and [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/)
from [John Maxwell](https://twitter.com/greenagain) of the [Agile League](http://agileleague.com/) at our 
[next meetup this Tuesday](http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Athens-Area-Software-Developers/events/94113712/).

Meetings are the first Tuesday of the month.  Food starts at 6:00pm and
presentations start at 6:30pm.  Follow
[@athsoftwaredev](http://twitter.com/athsoftwaredev) for future announcements
and keep up with the group.
