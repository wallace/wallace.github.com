<p>I lost my blog when an EC2 instance degraded and I had failed to make backups.
Who want’s a <a href="http://wordpress.org/">word press</a> blog anyway.  I recovered all

backed up by github, there won’t be any more problems.</p>

<p>Since then I now work <a href="http://highgroove.com/big-nerd-ranch.html">for a new
company</a> with the same old awesome
people plus a good many new awesome people.</p>
