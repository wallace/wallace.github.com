<h3 id="more-speaking">More Speaking</h3>

<p>When I first started learning Ruby on Rails way, way back in 2007, my only goal
was that I be able to “work when I want, where I want” so that I could guarantee
family time. If Chloe has a soccer game, I should be able to watch it. If
Charlie’s having cupcakes at school, I should be able to help serve them. If
Callie’s sick, I can comfort and nurse her back to health.</p>

<p>When thinking about which niche of software development would grant me that
freedom with a healthy dose of job security, I quickly settled on web
development. A few years into my web development career, I landed at <a href="http://bignerdranch.com">Big Nerd Ranch</a> (née Highgroove Studios <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/highgroove">before the merger</a>). At Big Nerd Ranch, I found a
company whose values matched mine which would allow me to work when I want and
from where I want.</p>

<p>That was in 2010. Once a goal is met, it is time to set new goals. After
settling in at Highgroove Studios, I found myself surrounded by super-sharp
people and I came up with new professional goals. I wanted to blog more, I wanted
to become an expert! I looked up to the speakers at the regional conferences I
attended. I loved learning from them and I wanted to share my passion for a
technology that facilitated me reaching my professional goals.</p>

<p>It took a while but earlier this year I had the pleasure of presenting at
<a href="http://rubyconfindia.org/2013/">RubyConfIndia</a> where my talk <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9JRsNJSpcs">was well received</a>.
Success!!  I was honored to be accepted and grateful that I work at a place that was
supportive (Big Nerd Ranch paid for my trip!) but I knew that I had more to do.</p>

<p>Before RubyConfIndia, my favorite Ruby conference was always RubyConf. Though I
love regional conferences, especially RubyHoedown, the breadth and depth of
RubyConf presentations always energized me more than any other conference. So it
is with great pleasure that I’m able to announce that I’ve been accepted to
speak at <a href="http://rubyconf.org/program">RubyConf 2013 - Miami Beach</a>.</p>

<h3 id="more-skills">More Skills</h3>

<p>Yesterday I turned thirty five. So instead of working on my lengthy todo list of
personal projects, I decided to learn a new skill, once that I’ve been aching to
learn for some time now, making gifs where only one part of it moves.</p>

<p>Check it out!</p>
