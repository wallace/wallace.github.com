      <p>At <a href="http://bignerdranch.com">Big Nerd Ranch</a>, we often times use <a href="http://campfirenow.com/">campfire</a> for
chat.  We’ve integrated the awesome <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot">hubot</a> but
with <a href="https://github.com/bignerdranch/nerdbot">our own little twist</a>.</p>

<p>We also love the command line and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">irc</a>.  To some this end, a
few nerds use <a href="http://www.weechat.org/">weechat</a>.  And we also love to recognize
greatness, whether it be wit, helping another nerd, a hilarious gif or any other
general silliness that we enjoy.</p>

<p>Mix all this together and an enterprising nerd might find a need to quickly
<a href="https://github.com/bignerdranch/nerdbot/blob/master/scripts/karma.coffee">bestow karma</a>
from within weechat.</p>
