<p>Way back in June, <a href="http://blog.bignerdranch.com/1643-never-use-resque-for-serial-jobs/">I developed a plugin for resque</a>.
Back then, <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/resque">resque</a> was horribly unmaintained
with hundreds of issues and numerous pull requests.  The internal API was a mess
but a few people got the ball rolling and have <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-09-22-resque--let-s-do-this">straightened the project out</a> for the most part.</p>

<p>At the time, I wasn’t able to implement all the features that I wanted but just
enough to cover the basics.  Since then, a nice, kind soul has come along and
implemented the features they needed.  A huge thank you to <a href="https://github.com/miyagawa">Tatsuhiko Miyagawa</a> for his <a href="https://github.com/wallace/resque-lonely_job/pull/4">pull request</a>.</p>

<p>I’m happy to release <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/resque-lonely_job/versions/0.0.4">version 0.0.4 of resque-lonely_job</a>.  Enjoy!</p>
