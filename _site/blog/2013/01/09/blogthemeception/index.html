<p>I knew that I wanted to differentiate my blog visually when it arose from the
dead.  I did not want to use the default theme provided by whatever blogging
platform I eventually settled on.</p>

<p>After looking around at many static site generators, I settled on <a href="http://octopress.org/">http://octopress.org/</a> and
perused the <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes">3rd party themes</a>.
I found a <a href="http://blog.justin.kelly.org.au/octopress-theme/">nice clean theme</a>
but there was a tiny problem.  It wasn’t packaged up so that I could, with one
command, install it.  (OH THE HORROR!  Someone on the internet gave away
something for free yet I still had to do some work to get it to work for me.)</p>

<p>Being a good open source citizen, I decided to package it up to make it easier
for others to use.  Voila!  You too can now have the awesomeness of the
  <a href="https://github.com/wallace/justin-kelly-theme">justin-kelly-theme</a>.  Enjoy!</p>
