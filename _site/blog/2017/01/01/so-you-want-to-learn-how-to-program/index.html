<meta name="description" content="There’s only question that I’ve been asked more than “What do I do to learn how to program?”*. I’m pretty certain that the programming focused question will surpass the current champion sometime in 2017. In this post, I’ll answer how to learn to program at a high level, follow up with some concrete references for getting started as well as my roadmap for Ruby and Rails. Motivation There is only one secret to learning software development successfully: motivation. Stay motivated. If you know why you’re motivated, you’ll be able to best nurture your interest and desire. Are you learning software development so that you may edit a webpage? Customize your myspace page? Build a website? Know how to speak coherently to your contractors as you spec out your nifty startup? Script hot keys in your video game? Write a pokebot for facebook? Webscrape your favorite youtube videos? If you have an existing end goal in mind, re-visiting it will help when you find yourself struggling with a new concept or piece of technology. Mentors Another way to help maintain your motivation, and the second most important thing you can do is to find mentors. You don’t have to have multiple mentors but find at least one. A good mentor will help you maintain your motivation by focusing on your successes, acknowledging your struggles, and helping you when you get stuck on the little things. Getting stuck on the little things happens all the time to all programmers of all experience levels. For example, you found a nifty stack overflow solution and you pasted it in your editor and it doesn’t work. You understand the solution on stack overflow, it makes sense that it should work but it does not. As a programmer, I always feel ignorant. I always feel that there is more to learn or that something I’m trying to learn seems very difficult. It makes my brain hurt. That’s normal. Eventually, you have longer and longer stretches of productivity but those moments of struggle never fail to re-appear. If you can learn to love the process, you’ll love programming.
