  <p>Way back in <a href="/blog/2014/01/14/building-cyberdine-systems-with-kids/">December</a>, I promised that I would provide a year in review update. Finally, here it is.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/pagedooley/8349362069" title="Symphony for 2013 by Kevin Dooley, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8518/8349362069_380fe20922_n.jpg" width="320" height="143" alt="Symphony for 2013" /></a></p>

<p>Good grief, my year in review for 2013 lands halfway into 2014! Don’t they say that you need perspective to properly judge the past?</p>

<p>I <a href="/blog/2013/01/06/athens-developers-rejoice/">co-founded</a> and co-ran the <a href="http://developersofathens.com">Developers of Athens</a> group (neé <a href="http://meetup.com/Greater-Athens-Area-Software-Developers/">Greater Athens Area Software Developer Group</a>) for 2013. <a href="https://twitter.com/travisdouce">Travis Douce</a>, <a href="http://www.pendragondevelopment.com/">Jordan Burke</a> and <a href="http://glennstovall.com/">Glenn Stovall</a> took over as organizers and have been doing wonderful things. One of the other really awesome things is that Jordan met his cofounder at the meetup and started <a href="http://www.getvitaminc.com/">Vitamin C</a>.</p>

<p>I was a <a href="/blog/2014/01/14/building-cyberdine-systems-with-kids/">4H robotics instructor</a>.</p>

<p>I organized and facilitated the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/athens-code-retreat-2013-tickets-3788649954">2013 Athens Code Retreat</a> (with a little help from Travis Douce).</p>

<p>I spoke at <a href="https://twitter.com/IndianGuru/status/333158779917045760">RubyConf India</a>, <a href="/blog/2013/09/21/good-news-everyone/">Rubyconf</a>, and a <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/">Big Nerd Ranch</a> Tech Talk on <a href="https://vimeo.com/81416284">effective debugging in ruby</a>.</p>

<p>Other cool Big Nerd Ranch things that I can talk about include helping out at
three different recruitment fairs, helping out with sales and estimates as a technical contributor, being chosen for the first Leadership Development program and <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/serving-you-better-a-new-structure-for-our-team/">helping with our new organizational structure and becoming a backend manager</a>. This was in addition to launching a huge refactor for some customer work as well as leading other developers on the project and setting up onboarding documentation for the same project.</p>

<p>Tangentially related, I had a hand in both Travis Douce and Charlie Maffitt coming aboard at Big Nerd Ranch.</p>

<p>And finally, my team got <a href="/blog/2013/07/04/quick-recap/">2nd place at the 2013 Athens Game Jam</a> for <a href="http://marilynccole.com/nice-job-hero">Nice Job Hero!</a>.</p>

<p>That’s a pretty busy 2013 and I’m definitely feeling that 2014 is stacking up competitively. Great things have already happened that I haven’t even had the time to share yet but SOON(tm).</p>
