  <p>Today, May 1st, International Workers’ Day, twitter has been alive with chat of
<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/talkpay">#talkpay</a>.  <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/news/lets-talk-about-pay">An
article</a> in
<a href="https://modelviewculture.com">ModelViewCulture</a> requests that we share our
current salary, title and experience to combat systemic pay inequality. Though I
don’t agree with everything in the article, I’m choosing to take part.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/76657755@N04/7408506410" title="Money by Tax Credits, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7114/7408506410_715acb5f6f_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Money" /></a></p>

<p>There’s a huge social taboo against sharing salary here in the U.S. The topic of
complete salary transparency has been a topic that I’ve been discussing with
friends and coworkers for many years so I approach it with a great amount of
trepidation.</p>

<p>I fear violating the social mores and the possible consequences. I
fear revealing competitive information about my company’s business model. I fear
the power of other individuals interpreting my experiences and the arbitrary
values that others place on me in a non-flattering light. I fear alienating
co-workers. I fear alienating future co-workers. I also fear the
reductionist aspect of a title and two numbers.</p>

<p>I’ve never been someone that chases the highest paying job. I’ve always been
keen on having autonomy and respect. I’ve placed a premium of not having to
drive. I’ve placed a premium on being at home with my children. I’ve placed a
premium on working with kind, collaborative people. To share just the number
betrays the values that I hold dearest. A number doesn’t focus on what matters.</p>

<p>So I can’t leave it at a title.  I can’t just leave it at two numbers. I have to
tell the story. The reason to share this information publicly is to humanize the
gap. We already have the numbers that prove there’s a gap in aggregate. Let me
share my story so you know how and why I made the decisions I did and I hope you
may find something of value.</p>

<p>The power isn’t in the numbers. It is in using the numbers effectively. It is in
knowing your
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiated_agreement">BATNA</a>
and anticipating theirs. My biggest hope is that these numbers inspire or help
you in some way that I can’t anticipate.</p>

<p>Here’s my income to the best of my memory not adjusted for inflation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>1997 - 1998 Failed Consultant. I had to return the $600 I was paid because I never delivered.</li>
  <li>1999 - 2001 Intern. $18/hr no professional software experience.</li>
  <li>2002 - 2004 Graduate Assistant. I don’t remember what I was paid.</li>
  <li>2005 - 2006 I started working as the IT Manager for a restaurant chain
for ~$30,000. I was told that in 10 years I could probably be making $50,000.
When I received a raise of 10% after working over 100 hours in one week that
year in addition to traveling a good amount of the time, I knew that I’d have
to move on. Note, I managed computers and software, not people, despite the
“Manager” in the title. Fifteen days of PTO a year.</li>
  <li>2006 - 2007 IT Project Manager. Again, I had no direct reports. I worked here
for a year and a day and was paid $55,000 with a ~$5,000 bonus. One week of
PTO the first year (but you couldn’t use them until the end of the first
year) and two weeks every year thereafter.</li>
  <li>2007 - 2010 Web Developer. My first full time Ruby on Rails position.
~$60,000 and finished at ~$70,000. This was my first full time remote
position. I valued full time remote at a $30K-$40 premium. I believe I had 15
PTO days per year.</li>
  <li>2010 - 2015 Web Developer and Technologist to Backend Web Team Manager (with actual
reports). $60K - $118K. This is my current position. I can’t speak highly
enough of all the things that are not covered by those numbers. The people.
The faith, autonomy and trust the company places in their co-workers.  The
quality of the environment due to my coworkers. The “unlimited vacation” due
to <a href="http://gorowe.com/">ROWE</a>. The experiments we tried (including ROWE). The
diversity of backgrounds and experience while sharing the same desire for
self-improvement in a collaborative environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>What’s not covered above? All the concurrent moonlighting I’ve done from 2007
and continue to do now. Starting a local software developer meetup. Continual
mentoring that’s fostered my personal and professional growth.</p>

<p>Family support in all directions allowing me to focus on my career. Societal
norms and privileges not granted to others. Luck. Fortune. Blessings.</p>
