        <p><strong>Edit: How quickly information becomes stale. Before I had even written this post, the process for acquiring a VISA to visit India had already changed. In fact, it changed just a few short months after I went through the process. Instead of any of the below, go to <a href="http://www.visa.blsindia-usa.com/">http://www.visa.blsindia-usa.com/</a> and follow the instructions.</strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned in <a href="http://blog.jonathanrwallace.com/blog/2013/09/21/good-news-everyone/">an earlier post</a>, I greatly enjoyed my visit to India. However, there was a great deal of work to be permitted to travel there. In this post, we discuss what was involved in the preparation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/4nitsirk/2810126895/" title="Aga Khan Palace by 4nitsirk, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3292/2810126895_88f88ba8ba_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Aga Khan Palace" /></a></p>

<p>The short version: You’ll have to send off a form, another form, a passport photo, your passport itself, a copy of your driver’s license and $100 to the VISA processing location for your residence (for me, this was Houston). This takes about four to six weeks. It is best to get started as early as possible.</p>

<p>You start <a href="https://indiavisa.travisaoutsourcing.com/requirements/gather?apply=bymail">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re like me and visiting for a conference, you’ll select a tourist visa. Request a multiple entry visa for 6 months even if you won’t use it. The nuance is that the visa starts at the time its issued, not from your travel date, so you may as well request the maximum.</p>

<p>Then, you follow the <a href="https://indiavisa.travisaoutsourcing.com/requirements/display">instructions here</a>.</p>

<p>You may want to get vaccinated too. I went to the <a href="http://www.uhs.uga.edu/services/travel_clinic.html">UGA travel clinic</a> to get advised as to what vaccinations to get. Note, the vaccination schedules were lengthier than the time it took to get my VISA so get started even earlier!</p>

<h4 id="random-questions-i-had">Random Questions I had</h4>

<p>What did I put for ‘visible identification marks’ since it is required?</p>

<p>NA for Not Applicable as I don’t have any visible birthmarks.</p>

<p>What did I put for ‘citizenship ID’ since it is required?</p>

<p>NA again. Do not put SSN or something similar.</p>

<p>How do I know the place of issue of my passport?</p>

<p>It’s the stuff under ‘Authority’ which for me is ‘United States Department of State.’</p>

          </a>
        </h3>
        <p>At <a href="http://bignerdranch.com">Big Nerd Ranch</a>, we set up our <a href="https://github.com/jimmycuadra/lita">lita clone</a> (a ruby based chat bot similar to <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot">hubot</a>) so that it would generate Google hangout links for us that would allow us to quickly share the URL with a co-worker or client. But times, they be a changin’.</p>

<p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Barack_Obama_hangout.jpg" title="President Obama Google Hangout"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Barack_Obama_hangout.jpg" width="240" height="73" alt="president_obama_google_hangout" /></a></p>

<p>Our bot functionality was ultimately based on a hack of Google hangout URLs…
which no longer works.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://iamvery.com/">Jay</a><a href="https://twitter.com/iamvery">Hayes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The “old” implementation of nerdbot hangouts depended on the fact that G+
hangouts attached to events have static URLs. The “trick” was to create a G+
event far in the future and copy the URL to the attached hangout to a list
maintained in the Nerdbot’s environment.</p>

  <p>Now it seems that G+ event hangout links expire just like “regular” hangouts
after some time. :sob:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have a few ideas floating around about how to recreate the bot functionality
but they are a bit involved. One of the key challenges is that you must be
authenticated with Google to request a hangout.</p>

<p>Today, I realized that <a href="http://blog.jonathanrwallace.com/blog/2013/02/02/quickr-flickr-search/">one of my favorite tools, Alfred,</a>
should be able to help out.</p>

<h3 id="more-speaking">More Speaking</h3>

<p>When I first started learning Ruby on Rails way, way back in 2007, my only goal
was that I be able to “work when I want, where I want” so that I could guarantee
family time. If Chloe has a soccer game, I should be able to watch it. If
Charlie’s having cupcakes at school, I should be able to help serve them. If
Callie’s sick, I can comfort and nurse her back to health.</p>

<p>When thinking about which niche of software development would grant me that
freedom with a healthy dose of job security, I quickly settled on web
development. A few years into my web development career, I landed at <a href="http://bignerdranch.com">Big Nerd Ranch</a> (née Highgroove Studios <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/highgroove">before the merger</a>). At Big Nerd Ranch, I found a
company whose values matched mine which would allow me to work when I want and
from where I want.</p>

<p>That was in 2010. Once a goal is met, it is time to set new goals. After
settling in at Highgroove Studios, I found myself surrounded by super-sharp
people and I came up with new professional goals. I wanted to blog more, I wanted
to become an expert! I looked up to the speakers at the regional conferences I
attended. I loved learning from them and I wanted to share my passion for a
technology that facilitated me reaching my professional goals.</p>

<p>It took a while but earlier this year I had the pleasure of presenting at
<a href="http://rubyconfindia.org/2013/">RubyConfIndia</a> where my talk <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9JRsNJSpcs">was well received</a>.
Success!!  I was honored to be accepted and grateful that I work at a place that was
supportive (Big Nerd Ranch paid for my trip!) but I knew that I had more to do.</p>

<p>Before RubyConfIndia, my favorite Ruby conference was always RubyConf. Though I
love regional conferences, especially RubyHoedown, the breadth and depth of
RubyConf presentations always energized me more than any other conference. So it
is with great pleasure that I’m able to announce that I’ve been accepted to
speak at <a href="http://rubyconf.org/program">RubyConf 2013 - Miami Beach</a>.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Weechat has two main ways to extend its stock functionality, scripts and plugins. Plugins are C programs that are dynamically loaded. Writing C programs to extend my IRC client is more work than I care for so I stick to scripts.</p>

<p>Since I use scripts from perl, python and ruby I make sure to install weechat with support for those languages.</p>

<p><del>$ brew install weechat –ruby –python –perl</del>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ brew install weechat --with-ruby --with-python --with-perl</code></p>

<h2 id="scripts">Scripts</h2>

<p>Here’s a quick list of scripts that I use regularly:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/wallace/weechat-notification-center-rb">weechat-notification-center-rb</a> – notifies you in Mac OS X Notification center</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/wallace/weechat-nerdbot-karma">weechat-nerdbot-karma</a> – bestows karma, nerdbot style</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.weechat.org/scripts/source/buffers.pl.html/">buffers.pl</a> – lists your current buffers</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.weechat.org/scripts/source/urlgrab.py.html/">urlgrab.py</a> – quickly open up links of the cat images shared by coworkers</li>
</ul>

<p>Once weechat has started, you may type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/script help</code> to get an interactive script manager.  Unofficial scripts will not be listed in the interactive script manager so you’ll need to follow the installation instructions for <a href="https://github.com/wallace/weechat-notification-center-rb">weechat-notification-center-rb</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wallace/weechat-nerdbot-karma">weechat-nerdbot-karma</a>.</p>

<h2 id="startup">Startup</h2>

<p>I currently run camper_van as a proxy to my work campfire rooms, so I run <del><a href="https://github.com/aniero/camper_van">camper_van</a></del> <a href="https://github.com/zerowidth/camper_van">camper_van</a> in one terminal and then I set up a <a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s2/sh/c42cd246-a62e-481f-abbe-883983ac1016/794e8070a80d96a8b0f2bdf9c2320dc9/res/84d089e9-0852-49c2-b3e6-2150411b51b6/skitch.png">custom profile with a handy shortcut and startup command in iTerm2 to start up weechat</a>.</p>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>Here’s an example irc.conf for weechat.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4949912.js"> </script>

<p>I had to make a slight modification to how urlgrab worked so here’s my urlgrab.conf file.  I believe it was adding quotes around %s for localcmd.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4949942.js"> </script>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>I switch buffers with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/b &lt;buffer number</code>.  I bestow karma via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/karma &lt;name&gt; &lt;amount&gt;</code>.  And examining urls is a snap with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/url &lt;ordinal position of url most recent first&gt;</code> e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/url 1</code> opens up the most recent url in the current buffer.</p>

<h2 id="coming-up">Coming up</h2>

<p>You may look forward to what I had to do to install camper_van (war story!) and another plugin to start camper_van in the background as a hook_process on weechat so there’s no need to run camper_van in its own terminal.</p>

<p>I should also thank <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/about_us/nerds/charles_brian_quinn">CBQ</a> for pointing out the utility of custom URL searches from within alfred.  This features allows one to snag a URL and replace portions of the query string with custom text from within alfred.</p>

find how I’ve put my foot in my mouth.</p>

<p>I covered the basics in a <a href="http://blog.bignerdranch.com/1565-debugging-best-practices/">previous blog post</a> but one thing I’ve not stopped complaining about is the lack of debugger sessions.  And by that I mean the ability to save a set of break points in a running process, quit that process, and restart it again restoring the previous break points and watches.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cldwalker/debugger#reason-for-fork">ruby-debug19 is abandonware</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cldwalker/debugger">debugger</a> has taken over.  I was all set to dive into the source to determine how to hack in this functionality but imagine my surprise when I found its already available!  Checkout <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">save</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">source</code>.</p>

<p>Oh man, do I ever love open source.</p>

<p>Way back in June, <a href="http://blog.bignerdranch.com/1643-never-use-resque-for-serial-jobs/">I developed a plugin for resque</a>.
Back then, <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/resque">resque</a> was horribly unmaintained
with hundreds of issues and numerous pull requests.  The internal API was a mess
but a few people got the ball rolling and have <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-09-22-resque--let-s-do-this">straightened the project out</a> for the most part.</p>

<p>At the time, I wasn’t able to implement all the features that I wanted but just
enough to cover the basics.  Since then, a nice, kind soul has come along and
implemented the features they needed.  A huge thank you to <a href="https://github.com/miyagawa">Tatsuhiko Miyagawa</a> for his <a href="https://github.com/wallace/resque-lonely_job/pull/4">pull request</a>.</p>

<p>I’m happy to release <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/resque-lonely_job/versions/0.0.4">version 0.0.4 of resque-lonely_job</a>.  Enjoy!</p>

        <p>At <a href="http://bignerdranch.com">Big Nerd Ranch</a>, we often times use <a href="http://campfirenow.com/">campfire</a> for
chat.  We’ve integrated the awesome <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot">hubot</a> but
with <a href="https://github.com/bignerdranch/nerdbot">our own little twist</a>.</p>

<p>We also love the command line and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">irc</a>.  To some this end, a
few nerds use <a href="http://www.weechat.org/">weechat</a>.  And we also love to recognize
greatness, whether it be wit, helping another nerd, a hilarious gif or any other
general silliness that we enjoy.</p>

<p>Mix all this together and an enterprising nerd might find a need to quickly
<a href="https://github.com/bignerdranch/nerdbot/blob/master/scripts/karma.coffee">bestow karma</a>
from within weechat.</p>
