    <id>http://blog.jonathanrwallace.com/blog/2014/07/15/my-first-haskell</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I shared my <a href="http://blog.jonathanrwallace.com/blog/2014/07/06/my-code-retreat-syllabus/index.html">secrets to an amazing code retreat</a>. Since then <a href="http://bignerdranch.com">Big Nerd Ranch</a> held an internal code retreat (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/srbiv">Stafford</a>) and although I was only able to participate for a couple of sessions due to client work, I learned a couple of things and got to play with a new language. Can you guess which one?!? Read on to found out.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rockandracehorses/3783326324" title="Born To Run! Rachel Alexandra and Calvin Borel win the $1.25 million Haskell Invitational by Sarah K. Andrew, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3110/3783326324_154fe1441d_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Born To Run! Rachel Alexandra and Calvin Borel win the $1.25 million Haskell Invitational"></a></p>

<p>Though I&rsquo;ve stated many times how valuable I find code retreats to be, I&rsquo;m still impressed at how I continue to learn at a consistent rate each time I attend or facilitate. Lucky for me, this time I was able to participate which is so much fun.</p>

<p>I had three experiences that I&rsquo;d like to share.</p>

<ol>
<li>Way way back when, I shared <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/lessons-learned-at-global-day-of-coderetreat/">what I learned at my first code retreat</a>. Knowing how equality works in Ruby is a little tricky and understanding the importance of the hash and eql methods is key. But you can also get away with using the Comparable module (thanks <a href="http://stevenharman.net/">Steven Harman</a>).</li>
</ol>


<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4a0d0f0403a2b85b383f.js?file=point.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>class Point
  include Comparable

  attr_accessor :x, :y
  def initialize(x,y)
    @x = x
    @y = y
  end

  def &lt;=&gt;(other)
    return -1 if self.x &lt; other.x
    return 0 if self.x == other.x &amp;&amp; self.y == other.y
    return 1 if self.x &gt; other.x
  end
end

puts &quot;different points are different #{ Point.new(1,1) != Point.new(1,2) } &quot;
puts &quot;same points are same #{ Point.new(1,1) == Point.new(1,1) } &quot;</code></pre></noscript></div>


<ol>
<li><p>As I mentioned above, I only experienced two full sessions. I was interuppted in the third session where we were constrained to using mute ping-pong TDD. But what was interesting is how in the few minutes we did share, I started with a full integration test. This stumped my partner. And to be honest, it was a little unfair as there&rsquo;s no way he could write a passing test without resorting to some nefarious behaviors. I later found out that we weren&rsquo;t the only ones who found starting with a high level integration test challenging when we weren&rsquo;t able to vocally coordinate with our partner. There&rsquo;s got to be some profound insight related to documentation, abstraction and code rot over time.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, what I&rsquo;m most excited about is that I was able to pair with <a href="https://twitter.com/letsbreelhere">Bree Stanwyck</a> and we used Haskell. This was the first time I was exposed to Haskell other than via a presentation and we managed, with tests, to get a <a href="https://gist.github.com/breestanwyck/479faa4a274f7278b5fb">functioning Haskell GoL implementation</a> within the session. I was very impressed with Haskell and look forward to exploring it more in the near future. The elegance and simplicity allows the intent of the GoL algorithm to shine through.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>For my next step, I&rsquo;m planning on working through <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">http://learnyouahaskell.com/</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You may have heard about <a href="http://blog.jonathanrwallace.com/blog/2013/07/04/quick-recap/index.html">my adventures</a> with <a href="http://blog.jonathanrwallace.com/blog/2014/06/12/year-in-review/index.html">code retreats</a>. I greatly enjoy facilitating and participating and over the years I&rsquo;ve come up with a base itinerary. You can find the official structure <a href="http://coderetreat.org/facilitating/structure-of-a-coderetreat">here</a>. This is more of my specific predilections. The day won&rsquo;t follow this exactly and will vary according to skill level and participants interest but read on to see what I enjoy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/auteurdecinema/6157383349" title="Self-improvement in progress! by Kenneth Law, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6199/6157383349_77ef7d33dd_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" alt="Self-improvement in progress!"></a></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Breakfast (8am)
 The start of any good day begins with a good breakfast. I open the doors to the location around 8am for the early risers.</p></li>
<li><p>Introduction (~ 8:30am)
 The first thing I do is introduce myself. Then I&rsquo;ll</p>

<ul>
<li> talk about the itinerary of the day and the purpose of the code retreat. The importance of coding without pressure and seeking only to practice and improve.</li>
<li> Talk about the difference between perfection and reality (the how much we suck gap).</li>
<li> Talk about the 4 rules of simple design.

<ul>
<li>Passing tests.</li>
<li>Good names (reveal intent).</li>
<li>DRY &ndash; Don&rsquo;t repeat yourself (not just code but more imporant, concepts).</li>
<li>Small. Methods, classes, parameters lists, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Encourage people to pair with others of different skill levels and platforms and the importance of communication and collaboration.</li>
<li> Introduce GoL.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>1st session (~ 9am)
 Let people pair up and practice on the problem.
 Review the approaches used.
 Help the group reflect on what was done, why and the limitations of the approaches chosen.
 Remind them of the problem constraints, &ldquo;infinite grid&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p>2nd session (~ 10am)
 Ping pong TDD.</p></li>
<li><p>3rd session (~ 11am)
 Mute ping pong TDD (remind them to speak only about language details if they don&rsquo;t know the language they&rsquo;ve agreed upon, not implementation questions)</p></li>
<li><p>Lunch break (~ 12pm)</p></li>
<li><p>4th session (~ 1:30pm)
 No loops, no if statements (secretly forcing functional programming paradigms and moving away from array based solutions)</p>

<p> At this point, take stock of the groups energy level. Determine by asking them whether they&rsquo;re up for one or two more sessions. Also by examining the excitement level in the room. If they&rsquo;re tired and interest is waning, I&rsquo;ll make the 5th session the last one. No one is at events like this for punishment purposes. :)</p>

<p> For the last session, I encourage people to have the freedom to make their own choices, no constraints.</p></li>
<li><p>5th session (~ 2:30pm)
  I often like to pretend that this session has no constriants only to stop them about 15-25 minutes in and add a constraint. Assuming this is the 2nd to last session, the constraint will be add a third state to a cell. You now have live, dying and dead cells. It now takes two ticks for a cell to die but once it starts dying it will die no matter what the generation after the next. While it is alive, it is considered alive for evaluating the state of other neighboring cells.</p></li>
<li><p>6th session (~ 3:30pm)
 Pair up with no constraints. About 15-25 minutes in, ask everyone to switch stations/ computers. In other words, you start with your own code base as a pair and finish with someone else&rsquo;s. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you know the language or not, that&rsquo;s part of the fun. I call these last two sessions consultant sessions as they mimic what happens with a consultant. 5th session is changing requirements. 6th session is rescue code.</p></li>
<li><p>Closing circle: Here&rsquo;s where we recap and give everyone a chance to share three things.</p>

<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;re you going to do differently going forward?</li>
<li>What most surprised you?</li>
<li>What did you learn?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<p>There&rsquo;s lots of other session idea out there too. Check out <a href="http://coderetreat.org/facilitating/activity-catalog">the code retreat website for more.</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Way back in <a href="http://blog.jonathanrwallace.com/blog/2014/01/14/building-cyberdine-systems-with-kids/">December</a>, I promised that I would provide a year in review update. Finally, here it is.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/pagedooley/8349362069" title="Symphony for 2013 by Kevin Dooley, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8518/8349362069_380fe20922_n.jpg" width="320" height="143" alt="Symphony for 2013"></a></p>

<p>Good grief, my year in review for 2013 lands halfway into 2014! Don&rsquo;t they say that you need perspective to properly judge the past?</p>

<p>I <a href="http://blog.jonathanrwallace.com/blog/2013/01/06/athens-developers-rejoice/">co-founded</a> and co-ran the <a href="http://developersofathens.com">Developers of Athens</a> group (neé <a href="http://meetup.com/Greater-Athens-Area-Software-Developers/">Greater Athens Area Software Developer Group</a>) for 2013. <a href="https://twitter.com/travisdouce">Travis Douce</a>, <a href="http://www.pendragondevelopment.com/">Jordan Burke</a> and <a href="http://glennstovall.com/">Glenn Stovall</a> took over as organizers and have been doing wonderful things. One of the other really awesome things is that Jordan met his cofounder at the meetup and started <a href="http://www.getvitaminc.com/">Vitamin C</a>.</p>

<p>I was a <a href="http://blog.jonathanrwallace.com/blog/2014/01/14/building-cyberdine-systems-with-kids/">4H robotics instructor</a>.</p>

<p>I organized and facilitated the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/athens-code-retreat-2013-tickets-3788649954">2013 Athens Code Retreat</a> (with a little help from Travis Douce).</p>

<p>I spoke at <a href="https://twitter.com/IndianGuru/status/333158779917045760">RubyConf India</a>, <a href="http://blog.jonathanrwallace.com/blog/2013/09/21/good-news-everyone/">Rubyconf</a>, and a <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/">Big Nerd Ranch</a> Tech Talk on <a href="https://vimeo.com/81416284">effective debugging in ruby</a>.</p>

<p>Other cool Big Nerd Ranch things that I can talk about include helping out at
three different recruitment fairs, helping out with sales and estimates as a technical contributor, being chosen for the first Leadership Development program and <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/serving-you-better-a-new-structure-for-our-team/">helping with our new organizational structure and becoming a backend manager</a>. This was in addition to launching a huge refactor for some customer work as well as leading other developers on the project and setting up onboarding documentation for the same project.</p>

<p>Tangentially related, I had a hand in both Travis Douce and Charlie Maffitt coming aboard at Big Nerd Ranch.</p>

<p>And finally, my team got <a href="http://blog.jonathanrwallace.com/blog/2013/07/04/quick-recap/">2nd place at the 2013 Athens Game Jam</a> for <a href="http://marilynccole.com/nice-job-hero">Nice Job Hero!</a>.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty busy 2013 and I&rsquo;m definitely feeling that 2014 is stacking up competitively. Great things have already happened that I haven&rsquo;t even had the time to share yet but SOON&trade;.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the good ol&#8217; days, when we used to walk up hill through the snow to school both ways, the Rails deployment process wasn&rsquo;t as simple as pushing to heroku. You might have signed up with a custom rails hosting provider or used a shared hosting provider. You may have had to configure Apache to use subdomains or even suburis. Now, most of these issues have been abstracted away. But not all the time.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, a <a href="https://twitter.com/Pvolitans">good friend of mine</a> found himself in the situation where you access the Rails app via aSubURI. Read on to find out what the challenges were for him and how we solved them.</p>

<p>The first couple of meetings we worked on building trebuchets which was a lot of
fun. We&rsquo;ve since started playing with the Lego Mindstorms NXT kits. We have
three of them and the kids need to share but it has been a great deal of fun.</p>

<p>In this pair of videos, we have a walking chicken.. sort of.</p>

<p>I often despair when I write down all the things that I want to do and must do as the list itself often overwhelms. But now that we&rsquo;re over the holiday hump and social obligations lighten their hold on my schedule, I&rsquo;m finding moments here and there where I&rsquo;m able to reflect over the last year. There&rsquo;s more than a few things that I&rsquo;ve done this year of which I&rsquo;m proud. But, this post is not the post where I discuss those things.</p>

<p>Instead, I&rsquo;m happy to announce that we&rsquo;re finally headed to Vancouver in February to visit our great friends, the Matheos family. This trip is something Kristina has dreamed about for many years and I&rsquo;m happy that we&rsquo;re finally able ot make it happen. We&rsquo;re billing this as our 10 year anniversary present since May 29, 2014 marks ten years of wedded bliss!</p>

<p>On a more technical front, I&rsquo;ve finally bitten the bullet and learned a little about minecraft. For my Christmas gift to Chloe and Callie, I&rsquo;ve set up a minecraft pocket edition server. This was not as easy as I hoped it would be. It required some time in the IRC channels but I finally stumbled onto the correct sequence of commands to set it up, <a href="https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/issues/1012#issuecomment-31226235">https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/issues/1012#issuecomment-31226235</a>.</p>

<p>That todo list is still waiting for me and I hope to knock a few items more off
before returning to work in January including a year-in-review post.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Edit: How quickly information becomes stale. Before I had even written this post, the process for acquiring a VISA to visit India had already changed. In fact, it changed just a few short months after I went through the process. Instead of any of the below, go to <a href="http://www.visa.blsindia-usa.com/">http://www.visa.blsindia-usa.com/</a> and follow the instructions.</strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned in <a href="http://blog.jonathanrwallace.com/blog/2013/09/21/good-news-everyone/">an earlier post</a>, I greatly enjoyed my visit to India. However, there was a great deal of work to be permitted to travel there. In this post, we discuss what was involved in the preparation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/4nitsirk/2810126895/" title="Aga Khan Palace by 4nitsirk, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3292/2810126895_88f88ba8ba_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Aga Khan Palace"></a></p>

<p>The short version: You&rsquo;ll have to send off a form, another form, a passport photo, your passport itself, a copy of your driver&rsquo;s license and $100 to the VISA processing location for your residence (for me, this was Houston). This takes about four to six weeks. It is best to get started as early as possible.</p>

<p>You start <a href="https://indiavisa.travisaoutsourcing.com/requirements/gather?apply=bymail">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re like me and visiting for a conference, you&rsquo;ll select a tourist visa. Request a multiple entry visa for 6 months even if you won&rsquo;t use it. The nuance is that the visa starts at the time its issued, not from your travel date, so you may as well request the maximum.</p>

<p>Then, you follow the <a href="https://indiavisa.travisaoutsourcing.com/requirements/display">instructions here</a>.</p>

<p>You may want to get vaccinated too. I went to the <a href="http://www.uhs.uga.edu/services/travel_clinic.html">UGA travel clinic</a> to get advised as to what vaccinations to get. Note, the vaccination schedules were lengthier than the time it took to get my VISA so get started even earlier!</p>

<h4>Random Questions I had</h4>

<p>What did I put for &lsquo;visible identification marks&rsquo; since it is required?</p>

<p>NA for Not Applicable as I don&rsquo;t have any visible birthmarks.</p>

<p>What did I put for &lsquo;citizenship ID&rsquo; since it is required?</p>

<p>NA again. Do not put SSN or something similar.</p>

<p>How do I know the place of issue of my passport?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the stuff under &lsquo;Authority&rsquo; which for me is &lsquo;United States Department of State.&rsquo;</p>

    <id>http://blog.jonathanrwallace.com/blog/2013/10/08/quickly-create-a-google-hangout-with-alfred</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="http://bignerdranch.com">Big Nerd Ranch</a>, we set up our <a href="https://github.com/jimmycuadra/lita">lita clone</a> (a ruby based chat bot similar to <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot">hubot</a>) so that it would generate Google hangout links for us that would allow us to quickly share the URL with a co-worker or client. But times, they be a changin&#8217;.</p>

<p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Barack_Obama_hangout.jpg" title="President Obama Google Hangout"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Barack_Obama_hangout.jpg" width="240" height="73" alt="president_obama_google_hangout"></a></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Our bot functionality was ultimately based on a hack of Google hangout URLs&hellip;
which no longer works.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://iamvery.com/">Jay</a><a href="https://twitter.com/iamvery">Hayes</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The &ldquo;old&rdquo; implementation of nerdbot hangouts depended on the fact that G+
hangouts attached to events have static URLs. The &ldquo;trick&rdquo; was to create a G+
event far in the future and copy the URL to the attached hangout to a list
maintained in the Nerdbot&rsquo;s environment.</p>

<p>Now it seems that G+ event hangout links expire just like &ldquo;regular&rdquo; hangouts
after some time. :sob:</p></blockquote>

<p>We have a few ideas floating around about how to recreate the bot functionality
but they are a bit involved. One of the key challenges is that you must be
authenticated with Google to request a hangout.</p>

<p>Today, I realized that <a href="http://blog.jonathanrwallace.com/blog/2013/02/02/quickr-flickr-search/">one of my favorite tools, Alfred,</a>
should be able to help out.</p>

<p>I have finally addressed the lack of tweets in the sidebar.</p>

<p>A goodly open source contributer <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/pull/1311">created a pull request</a> that updates the octopress twitter aside to <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/api-v1-is-retired">handle twitter&rsquo;s API changes</a>.</p>

<p>You have to <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/widgets">create your own twitter widget</a> and extract the data-widget-id.</p>

<h3>More Speaking</h3>

<p>When I first started learning Ruby on Rails way, way back in 2007, my only goal
was that I be able to &ldquo;work when I want, where I want&rdquo; so that I could guarantee
family time. If Chloe has a soccer game, I should be able to watch it. If
Charlie&rsquo;s having cupcakes at school, I should be able to help serve them. If
Callie&rsquo;s sick, I can comfort and nurse her back to health.</p>

<p>When thinking about which niche of software development would grant me that
freedom with a healthy dose of job security, I quickly settled on web
development. A few years into my web development career, I landed at <a href="http://bignerdranch.com">Big Nerd Ranch</a> (née Highgroove Studios <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/highgroove">before the merger</a>). At Big Nerd Ranch, I found a
company whose values matched mine which would allow me to work when I want and
from where I want.</p>

<p>That was in 2010. Once a goal is met, it is time to set new goals. After
settling in at Highgroove Studios, I found myself surrounded by super-sharp
people and I came up with new professional goals. I wanted to blog more, I wanted
to become an expert! I looked up to the speakers at the regional conferences I
attended. I loved learning from them and I wanted to share my passion for a
technology that facilitated me reaching my professional goals.</p>

<p>It took a while but earlier this year I had the pleasure of presenting at
<a href="http://rubyconfindia.org/2013/">RubyConfIndia</a> where my talk <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9JRsNJSpcs">was well received</a>.
Success!!  I was honored to be accepted and grateful that I work at a place that was
supportive (Big Nerd Ranch paid for my trip!) but I knew that I had more to do.</p>

<p>Before RubyConfIndia, my favorite Ruby conference was always RubyConf. Though I
love regional conferences, especially RubyHoedown, the breadth and depth of
RubyConf presentations always energized me more than any other conference. So it
is with great pleasure that I&rsquo;m able to announce that I&rsquo;ve been accepted to
speak at <a href="http://rubyconf.org/program">RubyConf 2013 &ndash; Miami Beach</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://http://rubyconf.org/program" title="good_news_everyone_im_speaking_at_rubyconf_in_miami"><img src="http://wallace-personal-images.s3.amazonaws.com/good_news_rubyconf.png" width="240" height="184" alt="good_news_everyone_im_speaking_at_rubyconf_in_miami"></a></p>

<h3>More Skills</h3>

<p>Yesterday I turned thirty five. So instead of working on my lengthy todo list of
personal projects, I decided to learn a new skill, once that I&rsquo;ve been aching to
learn for some time now, making gifs where only one part of it moves.</p>

<p>Check it out!</p>

<h3>Neuroscience</h3>

<p>I attended the <a href="http://neurogamingconf.com">NeuroGaming Conference</a> and learned how far, and how far there still is to go, in the field of neuroscience. I can&rsquo;t wait to acquire an <a href="http://www.emotiv.com/store/headset.php">Emotiv device</a> and do some hacking.</p>

<h3>Accolades</h3>

<p>A prominent leader in the free world <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathanwallace/status/332675734701215744">made reference to software and a feature that I specifically worked on</a>. He forgot to mention my name but we all knew who he was talking about, amirite?</p>

<h3>Speaking</h3>

<p>The same week that I was getting <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/remarks-president-applied-materials-inc-austin-tx">obfuscated accolades from the very top</a>, I received word that my talk proposal to <a href="http://rubyconfindia.org/2013/">RubyConfIndia</a> was <a href="https://twitter.com/IndianGuru/status/333158779917045760">accepted</a>. You can <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jwallace/effective-debugging">check out my slides</a> and <a href="http://blog.bignerdranch.com/3097-rubyconfindia/">check out my thoughts</a>. I&rsquo;ll post the confreak video once it is up.</p>

<h3>Gaming</h3>

<p>My team tied for second at the <a href="http://athensgamejam.com/">Athens Game Jam</a>. The theme was bad luck.  In our game, <a href="http://marilynccole.com/nice-job-hero">Nice Job Hero!</a>, a hero wrecks the city in pursuit of beating the bad guys with no thought to what those effects have on the average person. Benedict is the unlucky soul who must follow up and deal with the side-effects of the hero. We built the game using <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3d</a> and you can check out our
<a href="https://github.com/wallace/nice-job-hero">source</a>.</p>

<h3>Civil Service</h3>

<p>A few weekends later, I helped organize and participated in the <a href="http://hackforchange.org/">National Civic Day of Hacking</a>. Our local version, <a href="http://hackforathens.org/">Hack For Athens</a>, was such an excellent success that <a href="http://www.fourathens.com/about/team/">Jim Flannery</a> and <a href="http://kellystorm.com/">Kelly Storm</a> have been invited to go to D.C. to talk about our event!</p>

<p>My team put together a <a href="https://communities.socrata.com/developers/docs/athens-clark-county-districts">pair of</a> <a href="https://communities.socrata.com/developers/docs/acc-district-commissioners">public APIs</a> and a <a href="http://hfa-data-portal.herokuapp.com/">demo application</a>. You can check out the <a href="https://github.com/GSto/hfa-open-data">source for the demo application</a>.</p>

<h3>Organizing</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Athens-Area-Software-Developers/">Athens software developer meetup</a> that <a href="http://brownwebdesign.com/">Jess Brown</a> and I started
is going strong. We&rsquo;re one member shy of 100 after eight months of being in
business.</p>

<h3>Crawling</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10151568514288402">Charlie is crawling</a>.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s next?</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s way too many cool things on my todo list at the moment that I don&rsquo;t know
how I&rsquo;ll find the time to work on them all.</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll be facilitating a <a href="http://coderetreat.org">code retreat</a> in Asheville, NC this month.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m working on picking up Android skills in earnest.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s some open source projects that need my love.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping that the next five months are as productive as the last.</p>

    <updated>2013-02-13T18:11:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.jonathanrwallace.com/blog/2013/02/13/weechat-bliss</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in <a href="http://blog.jonathanrwallace.com/blog/2013/01/17/weechat-karmageddon/">Weechat Karmageddon</a>, I spoke about a script I wrote to make giving hubot karma easy-peasy.  In this post, we&rsquo;ll talk about the rest of my weechat setup.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/superfantastic/50088733/" title="Buddha dog by SuperFantastic, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/32/50088733_58935531ce_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Buddha dog"></a></p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Weechat has two main ways to extend its stock functionality, scripts and plugins. Plugins are C programs that are dynamically loaded. Writing C programs to extend my IRC client is more work than I care for so I stick to scripts.</p>

<p>Since I use scripts from perl, python and ruby I make sure to install weechat with support for those languages.</p>

<p><del>$ brew install weechat &mdash;ruby &mdash;python &mdash;perl</del>
<code>$ brew install weechat --with-ruby --with-python --with-perl</code></p>

<h2>Scripts</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick list of scripts that I use regularly:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wallace/weechat-notification-center-rb">weechat-notification-center-rb</a> &mdash; notifies you in Mac OS X Notification center</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wallace/weechat-nerdbot-karma">weechat-nerdbot-karma</a> &mdash; bestows karma, nerdbot style</li>
<li><a href="http://www.weechat.org/scripts/source/buffers.pl.html/">buffers.pl</a> &mdash; lists your current buffers</li>
<li><a href="http://www.weechat.org/scripts/source/urlgrab.py.html/">urlgrab.py</a> &mdash; quickly open up links of the cat images shared by coworkers</li>
</ul>


<p>Once weechat has started, you may type <code>/script help</code> to get an interactive script manager.  Unofficial scripts will not be listed in the interactive script manager so you&rsquo;ll need to follow the installation instructions for <a href="https://github.com/wallace/weechat-notification-center-rb">weechat-notification-center-rb</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wallace/weechat-nerdbot-karma">weechat-nerdbot-karma</a>.</p>

<h2>Startup</h2>

<p>I currently run camper_van as a proxy to my work campfire rooms, so I run <del><a href="https://github.com/aniero/camper_van">camper_van</a></del> <a href="https://github.com/zerowidth/camper_van">camper_van</a> in one terminal and then I set up a <a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s2/sh/c42cd246-a62e-481f-abbe-883983ac1016/794e8070a80d96a8b0f2bdf9c2320dc9/res/84d089e9-0852-49c2-b3e6-2150411b51b6/skitch.png">custom profile with a handy shortcut and startup command in iTerm2 to start up weechat</a>.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example irc.conf for weechat.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4949912.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>I had to make a slight modification to how urlgrab worked so here&rsquo;s my urlgrab.conf file.  I believe it was adding quotes around %s for localcmd.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4949942.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>


<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>I switch buffers with <code>/b &lt;buffer number</code>.  I bestow karma via <code>/karma &lt;name&gt; &lt;amount&gt;</code>.  And examining urls is a snap with <code>/url &lt;ordinal position of url most recent first&gt;</code> e.g., <code>/url 1</code> opens up the most recent url in the current buffer.</p>

<h2>Coming up</h2>

<p>You may look forward to what I had to do to install camper_van (war story!) and another plugin to start camper_van in the background as a hook_process on weechat so there&rsquo;s no need to run camper_van in its own terminal.</p>

<p>I should also thank <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/about_us/nerds/charles_brian_quinn">CBQ</a> for pointing out the utility of custom URL searches from within alfred.  This features allows one to snag a URL and replace portions of the query string with custom text from within alfred.</p>

<p>Tonight, for example, I created one that allows me to quickly search flickr for
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">creative common licensed</a> material.</p>

<p><code>alfredapp://customsearch/flickr%20creative%20commons%20search/flickrcc/ascii/url=http://www.flickr.com/search/?q={query}&amp;l=commderiv&amp;ss=0&amp;ct=0&amp;mt=all&amp;w=all&amp;adv=1</code></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been a big fan of debuggers ever since my first gig, an internship with
Cisco Systems in 2000, where I became very familiar with
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">gdb</a>.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ve had my complaints about the state of debugging in ruby.  Read on to
find how I&rsquo;ve put my foot in my mouth.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/charlottemorrall/3850109985/" title="Foot in mouth by {Charlotte.Morrall}, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2436/3850109985_ec24eef5f3_m.jpg" width="240" height="163" alt="Foot in mouth"></a></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I covered the basics in a <a href="http://blog.bignerdranch.com/1565-debugging-best-practices/">previous blog post</a> but one thing I&rsquo;ve not stopped complaining about is the lack of debugger sessions.  And by that I mean the ability to save a set of break points in a running process, quit that process, and restart it again restoring the previous break points and watches.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cldwalker/debugger#reason-for-fork">ruby-debug19 is abandonware</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cldwalker/debugger">debugger</a> has taken over.  I was all set to dive into the source to determine how to hack in this functionality but imagine my surprise when I found its already available!  Checkout <code>save</code> and <code>source</code>.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4696064.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>(rdb:1) help save
save [FILE]
Saves current debugger state to FILE as a script file.
This includes breakpoints, catchpoints, display expressions and some settings.
If no filename is given, we will fabricate one.

Use the 'source' command in another debug session to restore them.
(rdb:1) help source
source FILE  executes a file containing debugger commands
(rdb:1) </code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Oh man, do I ever love open source.</p>

<p>Way back in June, <a href="http://blog.bignerdranch.com/1643-never-use-resque-for-serial-jobs/">I developed a plugin for resque</a>.
Back then, <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/resque">resque</a> was horribly unmaintained
with hundreds of issues and numerous pull requests.  The internal API was a mess
but a few people got the ball rolling and have <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-09-22-resque--let-s-do-this">straightened the project out</a> for the most part.</p>

<p>At the time, I wasn&rsquo;t able to implement all the features that I wanted but just
enough to cover the basics.  Since then, a nice, kind soul has come along and
implemented the features they needed.  A huge thank you to <a href="https://github.com/miyagawa">Tatsuhiko Miyagawa</a> for his <a href="https://github.com/wallace/resque-lonely_job/pull/4">pull request</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy to release <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/resque-lonely_job/versions/0.0.4">version 0.0.4 of resque-lonely_job</a>.  Enjoy!</p>

chat.  We&rsquo;ve integrated the awesome <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot">hubot</a> but
with <a href="https://github.com/bignerdranch/nerdbot">our own little twist</a>.</p>

<p>We also love the command line and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">irc</a>.  To some this end, a
few nerds use <a href="http://www.weechat.org/">weechat</a>.  And we also love to recognize
greatness, whether it be wit, helping another nerd, a hilarious gif or any other
general silliness that we enjoy.</p>

<p>Mix all this together and an enterprising nerd might find a need to quickly
<a href="https://github.com/bignerdranch/nerdbot/blob/master/scripts/karma.coffee">bestow karma</a>
from within weechat.</p>

<p>I knew that I wanted to differentiate my blog visually when it arose from the
dead.  I did not want to use the default theme provided by whatever blogging
platform I eventually settled on.</p>

<p>After looking around at many static site generators, I settled on <a href="http://octopress.org/">http://octopress.org/</a> and
perused the <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes">3rd party themes</a>.
I found a <a href="http://blog.justin.kelly.org.au/octopress-theme/">nice clean theme</a>
but there was a tiny problem.  It wasn&rsquo;t packaged up so that I could, with one
command, install it.  (OH THE HORROR!  Someone on the internet gave away
something for free yet I still had to do some work to get it to work for me.)</p>

<p>Being a good open source citizen, I decided to package it up to make it easier
for others to use.  Voila!  You too can now have the awesomeness of the
  <a href="https://github.com/wallace/justin-kelly-theme">justin-kelly-theme</a>.  Enjoy!</p>

<p>At <a href="http://bignerdranch.com">Big Nerd Ranch</a>, many of us use <a href="http://campfirenow.com/">campfire</a>.  And many of us also use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a>.  We also dislike having unnecessary programs running so when we found <a href="https://github.com/aniero/camper_van">camper_van</a> we got excited.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we found a <a href="https://github.com/aniero/camper_van/issues/22">bug</a>.
But no longer fear, the bug has been <a href="https://github.com/aniero/camper_van/pull/23">cleared</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, if you can&rsquo;t wait for the pull request to be accepted and a new version
to be released you can do the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ gem install specific_install
